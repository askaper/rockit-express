# Rockit Express

My NoSQL approach to the original MySQL back end provided for front end developers at Rockit Bootcamp. 
Automatically generates API endpoints based on NoSQL data stores with MongoDB. With some help from my mentor, this is a very heavily modified version of the back end framework provided by the instructors at Rockit Bootcamp.

## test

I was provided this node and express back end API for my final project in RockIt. With the help of a mentor, we circumvented the need for a relational database schema and replaced MySQL with MongoDB using some additional frameworks such as monk and Mongoose.
